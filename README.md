# Software-Engineering-and-Human-Computer-Interaction

## Description: 
Our university group collaborated on a report focused on software engineering and human-computer interaction, centered on a project we developed ourselves, Myst (a website reminiscent of Steam).
The report delved into the principles of software engineering methodologies and user interface design, exploring how they were applied in the creation of our platform.
